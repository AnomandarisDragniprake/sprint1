Sprint1

Synopsis:
This project was created to aid those who are just becoming interested in anime.
It should provide a space where anime fans can leave reviews making it easier for new fans to find good shows.

Motivation:
When I first started watching anime, I found there was no real place to get a concise list of anime in certain genres
or ratings based on multiple people. I wanted to make this site to help other new fans so they won't have the struggle I did when I 
started watching anime.

Installation:
To get this code, enter--> git clone https://github.com/AnomandarisDragniprake/sprint1.git

I was the only contributor to this project
